# RoboFriends

## What is this ?

A simple project I did to learn React.

It uses [RoboHash](https://robohash.org/) to generate random robots pictures to fill user cards coming from [JSON Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).

You can see a live demo [here](francoiscordier.github.io/robofriends).

## How to run the project

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` in the project folder
3. Run `npm start`
